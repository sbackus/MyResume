## Cyrus Innovation Experience

### Client: Photo Sharing Android App
Sam worked as a software developer on the Android version of a niche social networking and picture sharing app.  The app communicated with a pre-existing backend to post and show pictures and update user information.  It was written in Java to maximize performance and to give the app a native android look and feel.

### Client: Online Retailer 
Sam  worked as a software developer on a Rails 2.3 to Rails 3.2 upgrade project for multiple applications and gems for an electronics reseller application. The upgrade required 14 custom gems and 4 client applications to be upgraded from Rails 2.3/Ruby 1.8 to Rails 3.2/Ruby 1.9. All unit and integration tests were updated to use the new syntax for RSpec and FactoryGirl. Open-source gems were upgraded to the most current compatible third party versions, including RSpec, Capybara, FactoryGirl, Devise, Warden. The upgrade also included converting a critical WarpDrive plugin to a Rails Engine gem.   
  
### Client: Crowdfunding Startup  
Sam worked as a software engineer for a project to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) application for a crowdfunding/crowdsourcing website geared to environmental and conservation initiatives. The project was developed using Ruby on Rails (Ruby v2.0, Rails v4.0). The application provided integration with social media (Twitter and Facebook) to drive users to the site. Other features included allowing users to edit and upload images to cloud-based storage using jCrop, Paperclip, and fog. User authentication is performed using Devise and allows for authentication using social media accounts.  It also included integration with WePay for payment processing.  Sam worked closely with the co-founders to define and prioritize the minimal set of features and to develop the product in a cost-effective manner.  
  
### Client: Small Gift Card Startup   
Sam worked as a software engineer to create several admin pages for an application that allowed users to buy and use gift cards and receive discounts for high end products. The pages were built using Scala and the Lift framework.
